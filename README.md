# Welsome to my writeups

This github repositoy contains the writeups for reverse engineering the binaries in the room `Reversing ELF`. Please be aware that I'm still learning reverse engineering, so if you see thatI'm explaning something in the wrong way, you see an error in any of the writeups, or have a suggestion for me, let me know using twitter `@ElvisErikvan` or my email `elviserikvan@gmail.com`. I'll be happy to hear from you
