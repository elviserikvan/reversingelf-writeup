# Welsome to my writeups

This github repository contains the writeups for reverse engineering the binaries in the room `Reversing ELF`. Please be aware that I'm still learning reverse engineering, so if you see that I'm explaning something in the wrong way, you see an error in any of the writeups, or have a suggestion for me please let me know using by my twitter account `@ElvisErikvan` or my email `elviserikvan@gmail.com`. I'll be happy to hear from you
